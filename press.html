      <h3>Barking Mouse Studio</h3>
      <p>Barking Mouse Studio is Danielle Swank and Jim Fleming. The studio is named after their dog, <a href="http://mousie-moo.tumblr.com">Mouse</a>. Lost Toys is the first game that they’ve spent more than a weekend working on. It’s the result of months of intense discussions and hand gestures (Danielle acted out the opening scene by pretending she was an airplane and zooming around their apartment). Programming and artwork are split fairly, and they both switch back and forth between the two.</p>

      <h3>Lost Toys</h3>

      <blockquote>Lost Toys, a 3D puzzler for iOS about broken toys.</blockquote>

      <p>Lost Toys is a tactile iPad rotational puzzle game made for and by introverts. It has a diverse set of influences from Rene Magritte’s The Treachery of Images, to modern games such as Cogs and Zen Bound, to Danielle’s experiences as a volunteer firefighter, to our backgrounds as both artists and programmers. Set in a surreal game world with a restricted viewpoint, players can examine and effect the objects around themselves. Lost Toys’ ideal player is looking for a mentally engaging but transitive gameplay experience (e.g. people that like sudoku or crossword puzzles).</p>

      <p>Made by an artist that took math classes for fun (Danielle) and an engineer that makes art (Jim), the majority of the programming (including most of the tricky bits) was done by Danielle since Jim keeps the lights on with his day job. It’s a meditative puzzle game about fixing things that are broken and leaving things better then when you arrive.  The theme is based on Danielle's first-hand knowledge, as a volunteer firefighter, of how good fixing things feels. It’s a game both Jim and Danielle wished was already out in the world, but since it wasn’t they decided to make it.</p>

      <p>Lost Toys opens with a descending spiral, where mixed-up toys emerge out of the murk of a burned and ruined room. To move upwards and progress through the game, players restore jumbled toys. There are no timers, points, scores, or percentages in Lost Toys, but there are  subtly discordant music transitions and trombone camera zooms. Turns can be infinitely undone without penalty, however the amount of time undoing takes encourages deliberate moves and forward thinking. All the levels take place in the same environment (past and future levels can be seen in the background) and the player is transitioned seamlessly from level to level.</p>

      <h3>Review Copies</h3>
      <p>We're happy to give out review copies to members of the press and talk to you about us and our game. Lost Toys is designed to be played on an iPad (3+) or an iPad mini.  It can be installed via TestFlight.  Please go to the link below and fill out the form with the UUID of your iPad. We’ll update the provisioning profile and you can then download and install the game from the TestFlight website.</p>

      <p><strong><a href="http://tflig.ht/TYrhxD">http://tflig.ht/TYrhxD</a></strong></p>

      <p>We designed the game with the intention of "no tutorials needed". The feeling of disorientation and discovery via trial-and-error is intentional. The first chapter of the game contains six levels and represents a fair introduction while the second chapter provides extended gameplay. We are slowly adding solution videos to <a href="http://support.barkingmousestudio.com">http://support.barkingmousestudio.com</a>. If you get stuck on a particular level, you can view the solution there or request solutions we don’t yet have up.</p>

      <h4>Additional Hints:</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Turns are made by swiping pieces on the screen with your finger.</li>
        <li>Turns can be undone by holding down a filled circle.</li>
        <li>If all your circles are filled in, you've run out of moves and need to undo.</li>
        <li>Dragging in the space around the object will rotate the all the pieces together.</li>
        <li>Turn the brightness up to full if things are hard to see.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>Lost Toys is a work in progress. The basic mechanics and artwork style are done, but only about 1/3 of the content / levels are currently in the build. We’re also still working on the ending sequence which will involve a slow rotation around the game space with close ups of the various levels with animation (e.g. as the player moves around the room they’ll zoom in on the ballerina level spinning slowly across the floor as the room transitions from ruined to clean). Future play testing is also required to fine tune the difficulty curve, with the possible addition of adaptive difficulty levels. Player state saving is not implemented yet. Pausing and switching applications is fine, but if you close the game by touching the red x in the application menu it will restart the game from the beginning.</p>
